## Best Practices for Security Researchers

- Use secure communication channels (e.g., encrypted email) when reporting vulnerabilities.
- Refrain from testing in ways that could compromise user data or the integrity of our systems beyond what is necessary to demonstrate the vulnerability.
- Follow ethical guidelines and responsible disclosure practices to ensure a safe environment for all users.

FieldGuardian-BACKEND reserves the right to update this Security Policy as needed. Changes will be published on this page and, where appropriate, communicated directly to users and contributors.

Thank you for helping us maintain a secure and reliable system.
